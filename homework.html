          The GUI and the personal computer took computers mainstream. Once a niche device used by technologists and artists, now we can't imagine not having one in our pockets at all time. Computers are still evolving and new technologies that extend the computers capabilities (ie peripherals like webcams and augmented reality headsets) have started to blur the line between the physical world and the virtual world. The book's timelines ends at around 2011 but there has been no shortage of game changing digital ideas since then. Do some research into what new technologies have been developed in the last decade, write about 5 ideas/projects/technologies you've found particularly interesting (1 paragraph each) and push it to your GitHub.

        <br>
        <p>
          After I've reviewed your homework from last week I will tell you which of your 5 ideas passes approval as a potential research topic for the final project. Of those that pass my approval, choose the one that most interests you. Begin conducing <b>background research</b> on this topic and answer the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?</li><br>

          <li> Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.</li><br>

          <li>What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?</li><br>

          <li>Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.</li>

          If you have not completed your background research yet, do so as soon as you can. If you have finished, then continue researching your topic more in depth. Consider the research advice/methodologies we reviewed this morning.

        <p>Draw a map of connections between the ideas/technologies expressed in the chapters above. This map should show the relationships between the various ideas (the different types of "mouses", TCP/IP, Hypertext, the Web, Browsers, Servers, etc.), who influenced who, what came before what else, etc. You can draw it however you'd like (photoshop, pencil, etc.) so long as you push an image file to your homework repo.</p>

          <b>Future Diary</b>
        </p>
        <p>
           Now that you've been researching your topic for a couple of weeks I want you to try and imagine what the future of the world with this idea/technology in it could be. Produce two fictional diary entries from the point of view of two fictional future folks. Imagine what the next 5 or 10 years of development in this technology will look like. Based on your predictions, you will answer the questions: Who will benefit most from this technologyand who will be disadvantaged most? Write two speculative diary entries from the point of views of someone from each group. These should focus on the day to day personal life of these hypothetical individuals but should clearly illustrate what it might be like in the future for this person to live in a world with this particular technology. Push your two future diary posts to your homework repo on github.

        <p>We've reached the middle of the semester (give or take)! There are no specific homework questions to respond to this week, but do make sure to reach the sections above (it will form the foundation for our conversations next week). Instead, take some time this week to catch up on missing assignments, in particular make sure you're up to date with the assignments associated with your final project (Idea No. 101) as you will be presenting "work in progress" the week after next. NOTE: remember that if you are interested in switching reserch subjects email me in the next couple of days for options.</p>

        <p>Start working on a studio project in response to your research subject, specifically the speculative future of this tech. This project can take any form in any medium, but has to be in direct conversation with your chosen topic. This could mean celebrating this speculative future, warning of or criticizing it, questioning it, etc. So long as it makes the audience consider what it might be like to live in a future world surrounded by this technology. Consider the relationship between the artworks in the readings above and the idea/topic they are juxtaposed with in the book.
           Also include "sketches" (images of work in progress) of the piece you're starting to work on which responds to speculative future of your research area.</p>

Include links to the files required below.

          <li style="margin-bottom:30px;">
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Research Method Image/Video</span>: Produce an image (height: 6.5”, width: 13”, resolution 150 ppi.) or video (under 1min) titled <b>"Research.jpg/.mp4/.etc"</b>, alongside a <b>"Research.md"</b> which includes a title or description, date of execution, medium, dimensions (height x width x depth), duration (hours:minutes:seconds 00:00:00) of the accompanying Reserach media file. In that same md file describe the relationship between your Research image/video and your own research. Why did you choose to document your research in this way?
