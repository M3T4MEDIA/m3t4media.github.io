                In the early days of the Internet, different communities from gamers to artists to journalists to fans of various things started their own BBSs. What are some examples of early BBSs that aren't mentioned in the book. Support your answer with sources. (extra props if you can find a BBS that is still active and you can figure out how to visit it!)

                The book mentions that Yahoo! purchased GeoCities and that, because they were loosing money on it, Yahoo! would eventually announce that they would be shutting it down. However, it did not mention the fact that this annoucement was made only a few months before the shut down. Yahoo! would be deleting all the data on the GeoCities servers, this meant thousands of early user generated websites would disappear from the Internet forever. Fortunately, some folks found those websites to be important and valuable pieces of Internet history and took action to try and preserve some of these sites. Who are these people? What did they do to save GeoCities? Support your answer with sources.

        <ul>
          <li>Idea No.9: the personal computer</li>

          The GUI and the personal computer took computers mainstream. Once a niche device used by technologists and artists, now we can't imagine not having one in our pockets at all time. Computers are still evolving and new technologies that extend the computers capabilities (ie peripherals like webcams and augmented reality headsets) have started to blur the line between the physical world and the virtual world. The book's timelines ends at around 2011 but there has been no shortage of game changing digital ideas since then. Do some research into what new technologies have been developed in the last decade. Using <a href="https://prose.io/" target="_blank">prose.io</a> in your own 'markdown' (.md) file in your "100ideas" GitHub Repo write about 5 ideas/projects/technologies you've found particularly interesting (1 paragraph each) and push it to your GitHub.

        <p>
          After I've review your homework for this week I will tell you which of your 5 ideas passes approval as a potential research topic for the final project. Of those that pass my approval, choose the one that most interests you. Begin conducing <b>background research</b> on this topic and answer the initial reserach questions (see next week's hw)

          Once i've approved some of ur 5 proposed topics, choose the one that most interests you. Begin conducting <b>background research</b> on this topic and answer the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?</li><br>

          <li> Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.</li><br>

          <li>What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?</li><br>

          <li>create a mind-map of connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area... for example:
            <img src="images/mind-map-ex.png" alt="example mind map" style="width:100%">
          </li>

      <article>
        <p>
          Prepare to give a 10min presentation on your resarch topic to the class. Slides/images are optional, but you should (at the very least) be preparred to share your mind map during your presentaiton (make sure it has been uploaded to your research project repo on your GitHub so that you can share it on the projector next wek). The scope of what you should cover should be similar to that covered in a Wikipedia entry, but before you simply rewrite the Wikipedia page review the <a href="https://github.com/M3T4MEDIA/notes/blob/master/wikipedia/README.md" target="_blank">Background Research + Wikipedia</a> notes.
