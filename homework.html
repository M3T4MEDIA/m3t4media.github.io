          The GUI and the personal computer took computers mainstream. Once a niche device used by technologists and artists, now we can't imagine not having one in our pockets at all time. Computers are still evolving and new technologies that extend the computers capabilities (ie peripherals like webcams and augmented reality headsets) have started to blur the line between the physical world and the virtual world. The book's timelines ends at around 2011 but there has been no shortage of game changing digital ideas since then. Do some research into what new technologies have been developed in the last decade, write about 5 ideas/projects/technologies you've found particularly interesting (1 paragraph each) and push it to your GitHub.

          After I've reviewed your homework from last week I will tell you which of your 5 ideas passes approval as a potential research topic for the final project. Of those that pass my approval, choose the one that most interests you. Begin conducing <b>background research</b> on this topic and answer the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?</li><br>

          <li> Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.</li><br>

          <li>What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?</li><br>

          <li>Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.</li>
